# ECSA
The main contributions of this work can be briefly highlighted as follows:
• Summarize the state-of-the-art works related to feature selection algorithms for intrusion detection system.
• Proposed a new swarm intelligence search algorithm (ECSA) based on the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). It effectively solves the problem that CSA is prone to fall into local optimal solutions by dynamically designing the awareness probability AP, flight length F, and adjusting the position updating method by using the cosine similarity, which significantly improves the convergence speed and optimization searching ability of the algorithm. 
• Test the convergence and optimality-seeking ability of ECSA by using six standardized test functions and compare the result with CSA. 
• Propose a novel feature selection algorithm for intrusion detection system based on ECSA. 
• Test the proposed feature selection algorithm and compare the result with four famous algorithms from the state-of-theart works.
